-- The sweep already closes out anything left mid-flight under a run it fails,
-- so a swept paper never leaves individual questions or pages frozen forever
-- (the orphaned-region bug found 2026-08-31). WP4 adds a third thing that can
-- be left running, and the sweep has to know about it or a run swept during
-- cropping leaves pages stuck at 'running' that no later run will reset.
--
-- The rest of the function is unchanged, including the 'done' -> 'pending'
-- structure reset added on 2026-08-31: this only adds the crop clauses.
