-- The previous migration revoked EXECUTE from PUBLIC on both new functions and
-- the advisor still reported them as callable by anon and authenticated. The
-- reason is the exact mirror image of the mistake corrected on 2026-08-31.
--
-- That time, revoking from anon and authenticated by name was the no-op:
-- Postgres grants EXECUTE to PUBLIC on creation and both roles inherit through
-- it, so only the PUBLIC revoke did anything.
--
-- This project also runs ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES on the public schema
-- (Axon-Site's 20260826074500_public_schema_default_grants.sql), which grants
-- EXECUTE to anon and authenticated *directly* on every new function. So a new
-- function gets both: the PUBLIC grant and two direct ones. Revoking either
-- alone leaves the other standing.
--
-- The rule, written down so it does not have to be rediscovered a third time:
-- revoke from PUBLIC **and** from anon and authenticated by name. Confirmed by
-- reading pg_proc.proacl afterwards rather than by re-reading the migration —
-- the ACL is the only thing that actually answers the question. Both functions
-- now read {postgres=X/postgres,service_role=X/postgres}.
